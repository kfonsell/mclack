**Slack clone with React, Redux, Semantic UI React and Firebase**

This is a "just for fun" project and serves as a nice example of using React, Redux, Firebase and Semantic UI components...
The project is far from being production ready, and I have no intention to make it production ready any time soon.  

Project structure is based on [create-react-app].
